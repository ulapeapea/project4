<h2><font color=#ffffff>WHERE DO I BEGIN!?!</h2>
<p><font color=#ffffff>Being in the foster system was the worse experience I had. It was the struggle to feel at home.Being bounced around foster home to another, not ever trying to adapt becuase i knew i was going to be sent if i started to feel confortable. Dont let me get started on my socia worker.At first she told me so much information that i wanted to hear.But as i got older i realized that they were lies after lies. When court came i learned that my social worker had told the judges a bunch of lies just to keep me in the system until i reached the age of 18. Being in the system just sucks, you never know where you're going to end up or what type of house it is, whether it is abusive or not. </font></p>
