<center><h1> The System Is Broken! </h1></center>

<h2>There are so much problems happening around the world in the foster system that are hidden behind all the lies. Although many people believe that taking a child out of their bad home situations and put into a stranger's home is the best way to "fix" their life's situations.</h2>
<h3><p>Many of America’s child welfare systems are badly broken — and children can suffer serious harm as a result. Some will be separated from their siblings. Others will be bounced from one foster care placement to another, never knowing when their lives will be uprooted next. Too many will be further abused in systems that are supposed to protect them. And instead of being safely reunified with their families — or moved quickly into adoptive homes — many will languish for years in foster homes or institutions.</p></h3>

<p> It's sad to say that there are many children out there without their family. Feeling abandoned can be the worst feeling that any child should not go through. Being seperated from your loved ones and being put in random people's homes. </p>
